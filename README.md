# Industrial Safety Management System [Submitted as a project for CSE 360: Computer Interfacing]

*Key Features: An Arduino based emergency fire/smoke/gas leakage alarm system for use in industrial settings. The system will constantly record values from different sensors such as gas, temperature and smoke sensors and display them in a remote terminal. In case of unusual or beyond threshold values, the monitoring system at the remote terminal will trigger an alarm. The utility of this system is to gain holistic insights that lead up to any accidents or hazardous events in an industiral environment by accessing different sensor values to better understand the incidents and prevent any future occurrence of similar events.

**Language/platform/Libraries Used: Arduino, Gas sensor, Temperature sensor, Smoke sensor, Java, Swing UI Toolkit**
